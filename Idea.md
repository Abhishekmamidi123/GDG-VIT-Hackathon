 # Student Analysis
 ## Motivation :
   There is a lot a student can do, rather than just attending the boring lectures(for attendance), taking exams and striving hard to pass them. Every student's capabilities and strengths need to be acknowledged. He should not be judged based only on his academic performance and attendance. At the same time, his weaknesses are to be verified and he should be suggested on how he can fight his weaknesses.
   
 ## What we do :
 We create a Web Application that stores data of every student. That includes logging of every activity he does. From attendance in class to participation in a club, from organizing an event to attending a workshop. We consider all the aspects that prove a student to be worthy. We give a teacher an apt analysis on a student considering all the aspects we have. 
 Teachers just have to log in and go to the student profile. The application involves a Graphical Visualization of that student, which is easy to understand and assess the student quickly.
 We give weightage to each parameter and based on the overall weightage he currently has, the student is judged whether he is up to the plausible mark or not.
